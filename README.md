# Synkro

Synkro is a collaborative engineering group focused on robotics, automation, embedded systems, and applied mechatronics.  
We design, build, and refine real-world solutions that integrate hardware, software, and intelligent control.

Our mission is simple: create high-impact engineering projects while documenting everything clearly so anyone can build, learn, and improve from our work.
